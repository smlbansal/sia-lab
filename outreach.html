										<h2 id="content"> Girls in Engineering Camp, UC Berkeley, 2019  </h2>
										<p> A week-long, non-residential summer camp for San Francisco Bay Area students entering 6th, 7th, and 8th grades to explore different aspects of what it means to be an engineer in a fun, hands-on environment. It was particularly exciting to explain what robots are to a group of middle-school girls, and to see their curiosity leading them to the very same fundamental research questions in robotics that I see my colleagues at UC Berkeley ask on a day-to-day basis. 
										</p>

										<h2 id="content"> Inclusion@RSS, Robotics: Science and Systems conference, 2019  </h2>
										<p> I mentored several early career graduate students who belong to groups that are traditionally underrepresented in robotics. I discussed how they could advance their careers as researchers and maintain their well-being as graduate students.  
										</p>

										<h2 id="content"> Berkeley School Volunteers, Berkeley, 2017-2018 </h2>
										<p> I teach math and science courses in after-school programs in public middle schools in Berkeley. In addition, I participate in interactive activities that are linked to the school day to enhance student learning experiences. 
										</p>

										<h2 id="content"> National Social Service Volunteer (<i>Prayas</i> Program), IIT Kanpur, 2008-2012  </h2>
										<p> As a part of <i>Prayas</i>, I taught underrepresented and underprivileged K-12 students who could not afford quality education. I also helped underrepresented high school students to prepare for the entrance exam for IITs, which is a very competitive exam, and typically requires supplemental coaching which these students could not afford. I was honored to receive the <strong>IIT Kanpur excellence award in community services</strong> for my outreach efforts (Award citation: “Recognizing the graduating student with outstanding work in various aspected of community services.”)
