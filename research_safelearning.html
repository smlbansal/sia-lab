									<p> Autonomous systems often operate in uncertain or a priori unknown enviornments, where it is hard to know all the safety constraints beforehand.

												Existing methods provide safety assurances under the assumption that once deployed, the system or its
												environment does not evolve. Online, however, an autonomous system might experience changes in system dynamics, control authority, external disturbances, and/or the surrounding environment, requiring updated safety assurances, which can be timeconsuming and often intractable to perform online. Assuming system and environment changes can be parameterized, we leverage recent advances in high-dimensional reachability analysis to compute <em>parameter-conditioned</em> reachable sets -- a family of reachable set parameterized by the uncertain system and environment factors. Online, as these factors change, the system can query the corresponding safety function from this family to ensure system safety, enabling a real-time update of the safety assurances.

												Human-robot interactions are an unavoidable aspect of many modern robotic applications and ensuring safety for these interactions is critical. In such scenarios, the robot often leverages a human motion predictor to predict their future states and plan safe and efficient trajectories, includinh high-capacity neural networks that can leverage the scene semantics to predict complex human behaviors. However, no model is ever perfect -- when the observed human behavior deviates from the model predictions, the robot might plan unsafe maneuvers. In this work, we propose a HJ reachability-based approach that maintains a confidence in the human model and automatically adjust the safety assurances online as this confidence changes based on the observed human behavior. Overall, our approach allows us to ensure a safe human-robot interaction even when the human model is incorrect. We demonstrate our approach in several safety-critical autonomous driving scenarios, involving a state-of-the-art deep learning-based prediction model.

												Real-world autonomous vehicles often operate in a priori unknown environments. Since most of these systems are safety-critical, it is important to ensure they operate safely in the face of environment uncertainty, such as unseen obstacles. Current safety analysis tools do not scale well to scenarios where the environment is being sensed in real time, such as during navigation tasks. In this work, we propose a novel, real-time safety analysis method based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability that provides strong safety guarantees despite environment uncertainty. Our safety method is planner-agnostic and provides guarantees for a variety of mapping sensors. We demonstrate our approach in simulation and in hardware to provide safety guarantees around a state-of-the-art vision-based, learning-based planner.
